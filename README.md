# Reeborg's world

This is my Code that I used to solve the Maze and the problematic worlds (zip file uploaded) in Reeborg's world (https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json). Which was part of Day 6 Final Project: Escaping the Maze from 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp on udemy.
